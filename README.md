# self assessment on all the three artifact
In a project like the animal shelter system, I would assess myself by looking at how well I contributed to both the technical and collaborative aspects of the work. From a technical standpoint, I would reflect on my ability to design and build features like the command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI). I would evaluate whether I wrote clean, efficient code, followed best practices, and ensured the system was user-friendly and secure. If I implemented features that made it easier for staff to manage animal records or helped prevent errors, I would see that as a success.
I would also assess how well I tested the system to make sure everything worked properly. This includes checking for bugs, handling errors, and making sure user input is validated. If I caught and fixed issues early or helped improve the reliability of the system, it would show that I was detail-oriented and committed to quality.
# self assessment from a team work perspective
I would consider how effectively I communicated with my group, shared responsibilities, and supported others when needed. If I was open to feedback and worked well with others to solve problems, I would view that as a sign of good collaboration. I’d also think about how I managed my timewhether I stayed organized and met deadlines.
Overall, I would measure my success by how much I contributed to making the project better, how much I learned during the process, and whether I helped create something that would genuinely be useful for the animal shelter and its staff. If I achieved those goals, I would feel confident in giving myself a positive assessment.
# self assessment for crud project and task service
For a CRUD project and task service, my self-assessment would focus on how effectively I designed, built, and maintained the system’s core functionality — Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations — as well as how I handled task management features.
From a technical point of view, I would assess how well I structured the database and how clearly I defined the data models. For example, if the project involved managing tasks with details like deadlines, priorities, and statuses, I’d evaluate how well I set up the database tables or objects to support these features. I’d also reflect on whether the API or interface I built was intuitive and consistent, making it easy for users to interact with the data. Writing clean and reusable code for each CRUD operation is essential, so I’d consider whether I followed best practices and kept the logic simple and efficient.
In terms of functionality, I’d ask myself: Did I make it easy for users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks? Was the user experience smooth and responsive? If I added extra features like search, sorting, or filtering tasks, that would show I went beyond the basics to improve usability. I’d also assess the security of the project did I prevent issues like unauthorized data access, or input errors that could crash the system.
From a personal growth and teamwork perspective, I’d consider how well I managed my time and responsibilities throughout the project. If I communicated clearly with team members, took initiative on tasks, and helped solve problems, I’d view that as a strong contribution. I’d also reflect on how much I learned—whether I improved my coding skills, got better at debugging, or learned how to use new tools or frameworks.
